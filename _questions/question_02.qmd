### Exercise 2: Preparing for Obtaining Data through APIs
In addition to the web-based interactive platform, FRED offers APIs to those who would like to acquire data through programs and in large batches (see the page for details: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/). 

To prepare for our practices during the workshop, make sure you have applied for the API key for FRED before the workshop (VERY IMPORTANT!). Below are the detailed steps

* Visit the FRED's API webpage (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/) and click the link to "API Keys."

* Request your own API key:

* You will see a pop-up window asking for signing in. Click "create new account" at the top and you will get to the following page:

* Use your Uni email address to register. For the question "In what context do you use FRED?", choose "Student."

* Once you finish your registration, you will be automatically directed to the API request page. Click "+ Request API Key".

* In the next page, briefly describe why you are applying for the API access.

* You will now see your API key on the page. MAKE SURE that you copy and store the key safely. Do not share your API key with others, as doing so may block your access to the FRED API.

* If you forget your API key, you can retrieve it from FRED using your registered email and log-in credentials.
